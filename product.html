        <h1>Oarweed</h1>
        <p>
          Historically, varieties of kelp like oarweed have been an important
          source of food for both humans and animals. Its unique flavor makes
          it a versatile ingredient that can be cooked in many different ways.

          <h2>WHERE TO FIND IT</h2>
          <p>
            Unlike many seaweeds that fare best in the intertidal zone or
            shallow water where there is plenty of sunlight, sweet kelp needs
            to be permanently submerged in water and therefore grows at
            greater depthsâ€”sometimes as far down as 30 meters. Sweet kelp also
            needs adequate salt levels in the water, so the closer you are to
            the less salty Baltic Sea, the less likely you are to find it.
            Sweet kelp often grows in bodies of water surrounded by large
            forests.

            <h2>HOW TO PICK IT</h2>
            <p>
              Sweet kelp grows from the bottom of the leaf, so the freshest
              parts will be found stem and leaf meet. When gathering sweet
              kelp, be sure to cut off the entire leaf above the stem so that
              a new leaf can grow.

          <section class="info_cirkel3">
            <h2>HOW TO SPOT IT</h2>
            <p>
              Sweet kelp produces a single long brown leaf from its stem,
              which is attached to rock. The light, ruffled leaf can grow up
              to three meters long and resembles moist leather.
