                Unlike many other kelp species that do best in the intertidal zone or in shallow water where there is good sunlight, finger kelp must always be covered by water. You will therefore find it at slightly greater depths - down to 30 metres. There must also be a good amount of salt in the water for fingerling to thrive, so the further towards the Baltic you go, the less likely you are to find fingerling. Finger kelp often grows in large forests - the less salt there is in the water, the greater the depths the finger kelp will search for in order to survive.
